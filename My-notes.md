## Student Responsibilities
Between Week 15 Friday evening and Monday mid-day of Week 16, submit your project proposal in this format to your project advisor:

   Project Name: CloneBnB
   Clone: Airbnb
   Feature List: http://github.com/your-github-user/your-project-repo/wiki/features
   Github: http://github.com/your-github-user/your-project-repo/
   Scorecard: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/
   Live Link: https://name-of-app.herokuapp.com

[x] Join your new "team" Slack channel which you will be invited to no later than EOD on Friday of Week 15. Your team consists of all the students that have the same project advisor as you. You will have daily stand ups with your team.

Every day you will attend stand up with your advisor and the other students in your team -- be prepared to show your screen and discuss what you worked on the day before, what you will work on that day, and any blockers you are currently having. Remember, this is not a time for debugging.

Complete all nightly reports as usual and use these reports to reflect on your progress. We rely on these reports to check in on your progress so please, as always, take them seriously. Some examples:

 - "I expected to finish the frontend for logging in, but still need to debug my onSubmit."

 - "At the beginning of the day, I was very confused about the Redux cycle, but going through debugger waterfalls while testing my action creators on the window really helped."

 - "Today I really struggled with destructuring my state. I think the next time I do a project like this, I will structure my frontend state to use more slices and less nesting."

You are required to push to Github a minimum of twice a day. This will be monitored by your Instructors.
You are encouraged to use development branches to complete your features and debugging branches if soliciting help from instructors. Push to your main branch when you have working functionality.
